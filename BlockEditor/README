pyCodeGenCenter.py is a utility which allows t0 generate 
realtime code starting from a gEDA schematic and a script
with variables initialization.

Special blocks have been developped for generating control
schematic in the gEDA schem environment.

HOW TO USE THE TOOL
1) pyCodeGenCenter
2) 2 Menus are available:
   SCH->PY: 
      gEDA schem:open the gEDA schematic gschem
      gEDA attrib: open the gEDA gattrib application
      Code Generation: open a dialog to generate the executable by passing:
      	   the gschem schematic file
	   the sampling time
	   additionals python scripts (for example with var initialization)
	   the template makefile (sim.tmf for simulation or rt.tmf for RT code)
	 The configuration on the dialog can be saved and loaded (.cfg file)

   File:
     Open:Open a schematic file and write the python corresponding code
          into the text window; the text can be modified
     Save: Save the code into a python script
     Save As: Save the code into a python script
