Blocks can be dragged from the library viewer and dropped on the editor. Right-click on a block in 
the Editor will show all options. (note that adding parameters is not supported). Input pins are shown
little arrow heads, and outputs as little squares. 

Changing the name can be done directly by clicking in the text-label below a block, or via the 
right-click menu. The block can be flipped in the x direction, to enhance the readability.

To draw a connection you have to click on a block output, a node or an input pin
